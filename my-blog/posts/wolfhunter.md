 Find one thing you know the code does, and trace those actions backward, starting at the end. for example, you know that the code you’re viewing ultimately creates a file with a list of movie titles. Figure out where in the code — the _specific, few lines_ — it generates that file. Then, move one step backward and figure out how it places the info in the file. Then, move another step backward and figure out where the info came from. And so on…
 Read more good code, so you can learn and implement good coding habits.


```python

print(hello world)
